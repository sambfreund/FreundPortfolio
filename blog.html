						<h2>Daily News</h2>
						<h5>January 29th, 2019</h5>
						
						<p>Nearly every day, I attempt to pull together a decent collection of relevant news. Most of it is nerdy news, and I try to stay away from politics. Thanks for being here!</p>

						<p>A bit of a ramble...
So I've been working on waking up earlier again. Getting back to my old ways. This has been helpful in terms of getting things done in the morning, but an issue I've found with this is that if you don't sleep well... you're super tired., and getting a few extra hours of sleep may have done more good than harm. However, I've been slacking on my exercise lately so that may be a factor. This made me think, "can waking up early make it easier to measure all of the other balances in your life?" ex: nutrition, exercise, mental heath, etc. Being an early riser isn't going to make you super self-conscious or anything, but I do think those factors might be smidge easier to pick out. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Favorite Reading Quotes</b></p>

<p>Two moments out of <b>The Final Empire</b> by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b> that I appreciated. I have a few other highlights in this series, but I don't want to spoil this book for anyone who may read it. I've really enjoyed it so far. I'm on page 450 or so, we'll see if I still like it when it's over lol but I have high hopes. So far, I would recommend, but the first 150 pages ore so are much slower than the rest of the book. </p>

<p>“Yes, I keep the flower,” Kelsier said. “I’m not really sure why. But…do you stop loving someone just because they betray you? I don’t think so. That’s what makes the betrayal hurt so much—pain, frustration, anger…and I still loved her. I still do.”“How?” Vin asked. “How can you? And, how can you possibly trust people? Didn’t you learn from what she did to you?”Kelsier shrugged. “I think…I think given the choice between loving Mare—betrayal included—and never knowing her, I’d choose love. I risked, and I lost, but the risk was still worth it. It’s the same with my friends. Suspicion is healthy in our profession—but only to an extent. I’d rather trust my men than worry about what will happen if they turn on me.”

I just thought this was funny because the intention was to fire up the female protagonist.
“Women?” Elend asked. “Women are like…thunderstorms. They’re beautiful to look at, and sometimes they’re nice to listen to—but most of the time they’re just plain inconvenient"</p>

<p><b>News</b></p>

<p>So many good articles today. Having the opposite problem I had yesterday. Tried to filter these down a bit.</p>

<p><b>Tech & Games</b></p>

<p>This had a lot of good clips in it, a good ole Black Ops tomahawk win was in there.

<p>I have a few old gaming magazines, I knew they would be nostalgic to read years down the road and that has held to be true. Good stuff.

<p>This is the same Chromebook I have (but a year older). Big fan. As long as you're not gaming or using heavy software, chromebooks are great.

<b><p>Self / Motivation</p></b>

<p>This was relevant to my morning ramble. Remove the Write/Read story bit, that is very similar to my morning routine lol. However, this news bit has taken some time. 
<a href="https://medium.com/@danny_forest/a-morning-routine-really-does-set-you-up-for-success-heres-a-6-step-process-to-create-one-44681c361674" target="_blank">Morning Routines</a></p>

<b><p>Misc</p></b>

<p>Overall, this is an article about UFO abductions, but there were bits and pieces of it I found to be funny.

<p>I don't think we really want this at a Super Bowl party, but a 12-pound taco is impressive:
