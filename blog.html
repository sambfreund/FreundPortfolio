							<p>My mom always said February is the longest month of the year. The cold just lingers and by this point, you're more than ready for that cold to be gone. Of course this depends where you're from. For some people it might be 75 and sunny right now! For me, I'd say January is the longest month. You know you have plenty of cold to go, and you've already been in plenty of it. However, on a more optimistic side of things, I think January covers up its dreariness with the excitement of being in a new year. People hit the ground running with all these new ambitions until February sucker punches them right in the face. Maybe mom was right... What's your favorite/least favorite month?</p>

							<h2>Favorite Reading Quotes</h2>
							<p>Here are a few snippets from <strong>Sleeping Giants</strong> by <strong>Sylvain Neuvel</strong>. This book was written in a unique fashion. It's basically a compilation of fictional transcripts that unfold into an interesting sci-fi experience. While I didn't overly enjoy this book as a whole, I did really enjoy how unique of a read it was.</p>
							<p>I've said this in the past, but I really like when a quote sparks your imagination. Which is exactly what this first one did for me. Instantly brought me to a different planet where there was another intelligent species learning some of the basic skills for the first time such as fire. What's even more interesting to think about is if they did these things in a different order than us.</p>
							<blockquote>It seems reasonable to assume that most or all species similar to humans would go through more or less the same evolutionary steps. Make fire, invent the wheel, those types of things.</blockquote>
							<p>This part of the story was just during a hospital visit. I found it pretty funny to bring someone who's in the hospital (assuming they're only in there for something not so serious) a gift card to a place like Lowe's, Menard, or Home Depot.</p>
							<blockquote>He only stayed for a minute, but he brought me a present, as he called it. A gift card, $25 at the Home Depot. I laughed my head off. That was the point, I guess.</blockquote>

							<h2>News</h2>
