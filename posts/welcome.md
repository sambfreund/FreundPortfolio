Hey, thanks for stopping by! This blog has been a long time coming and I'm excited to finally have a space to share some thoughts.

You can expect a mix of topics here. Some tech and quality engineering, some book recommendations, maybe a disc golf story or two, and whatever else happens to be on my mind.

If you want to learn more about me, check out the [About](index.html) page. Otherwise, stay tuned for more posts soon.
